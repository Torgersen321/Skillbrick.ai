# Remediation Plan: Task Master AI Update Reliability

This document outlines the steps to remediate the JSON parsing errors encountered during `task-master update` AI-driven operations.

## Incident Reference

- **Problem:** `task-master update` fails due to invalid JSON generated by the Claude AI API for complex task updates.
- **Root Cause:** AI model generating syntactically incorrect JSON for nested structures.
- **Solution Architecture:** [Link to Solution Architecture Document or Summary]

## Remediation Steps

Based on the Solution Architecture Document, the following steps will be taken:

- [x] **Step 1: Immediate Remediation (Manual Task #3 Update)**
    - Manually construct the correct JSON structure for Task #3 and its subtasks, reflecting the shift to Supabase Auth.
    - Edit `tasks/tasks.json` to replace the existing subtasks for Task #3 with the new definition.
    - **Goal:** Unblock the immediate development workflow need for Task #3.

- [x] **Step 2: Locate `task-master update` Script**
    - Search the codebase (primarily `scripts/` directory) for the source code responsible for the `task-master update` command logic.
    - Determine if the script is locally modifiable or if it's part of a globally installed package.
    - **Outcome:** Script confirmed to be part of a globally installed package (`claude-task-master`) and is not locally modifiable.
    - **Goal:** Ascertain feasibility of implementing Layers 2 & 3.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement Enhanced Error Handling (Layer 2)** - *Skipped: Script not locally modifiable.*
    - If the script is modifiable:
        - Add `try...catch` block around the `JSON.parse()` call handling the AI response.
        - Implement logging of the raw AI response string and specific error details upon catching a parsing error.
        - Ensure the script exits gracefully without attempting to write invalid data.
    - **Goal:** Improve diagnostics and prevent data corruption on AI errors.

- [ ] **Step 4: Define JSON Schema (Layer 3 Prep)** - *Skipped: Script not locally modifiable.*
    - If the script is modifiable:
        - Create `tasks/task_schema.json` defining the expected structure of `tasks.json`.
    - **Goal:** Prepare for schema validation.

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement Schema Validation (Layer 3)** - *Skipped: Script not locally modifiable.*
    - If the script is modifiable:
        - Add `ajv` dependency (or similar).
        - Implement logic in the `task-master update` script to validate the AI's JSON response *string* against `tasks/task_schema.json` *before* parsing.
        - Log schema validation errors and the raw JSON if validation fails. Reject the update if invalid.
    - **Goal:** Proactively prevent parsing errors and structurally invalid data.

- [x] **Step 6: Update Documentation**
    - Update `README.md` and/or `dev_workflow.mdc` to:
        - Mention the possibility of AI update failures for complex tasks.
        - Explain the new error logging behavior (if implemented).
        - Describe the schema validation step (if implemented).
        - Recommend manual updates as a fallback for complex changes.
    - **Goal:** Keep project documentation aligned with the tool's behavior and known limitations.

- [x] **Step 7: Validation & Monitoring**
    - After implementation, run the `task-master update` command again (potentially with a different complex prompt) to verify the error handling/validation works.
    - **Outcome:** Confirmed that the manual update to Task #3 is successful and the AI update command still fails for complex prompts as expected, validating the RCA.
    - Monitor logs for any future occurrences.
    - **Goal:** Confirm the remediation effectiveness.
