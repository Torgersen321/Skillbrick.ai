# Current Context

## Active Task

- **Task #2: Design Database Schema**
  - **Subtask #2.1: Create User Table Migration** (Adapting to use Supabase `auth.users` + `profiles` table)

## Background

- Completed Task #1: Setup Project Repository and Environment (Frontend: Vite/React/TS, Backend: Express/TS, CI: GitHub Actions basic setup, DB: Supabase via MCP).
- Generated PRD content (`PRD_Skillbrickv1.txt`, although file might be deleted from workspace view).
- Updated `README.md` and attempted update for `project_brief.md`.

## Current Focus

- Preparing database schema migrations for Supabase.
- Generated SQL for the `profiles` table (linked to `auth.users`).

## Next Steps

1.  **User Action:** Manually apply the generated SQL migration for the `profiles` table to Supabase project `bsfnsbmpyopbyeptuhyc` (due to MCP auth issues).
2.  Mark subtask 2.1 as done.
3.  Proceed to Subtask 2.2: Create ContentItem Table Migration.

## Open Questions

- How to resolve MCP authorization issues for direct Supabase actions (migrations, listing projects)?

## Recent Changes

- Completed Task #1 and subtasks.
- Started Task #2.
- Generated SQL for `profiles` table migration.

## Mode: IMPLEMENT
